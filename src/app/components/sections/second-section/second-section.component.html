    <h4>
      Iâ€™m a passionate software developer looking for <br />
      my first international oppotunity
    </h4>
    <p>
      Beyond coding, I'm a coffee enthusiast, a cat lover, and a self-taught
      artist who <br />
      enjoys spending my free time doodling. I am currently seeking
      opportunities to <br />
      bring my skills and enthusiasm to a tech company in the United States or
      Europe <br />
      and am excited about the prospect of relocating to pursue new challenges.
